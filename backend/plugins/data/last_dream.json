    "last_dream": "Here is the raw, unfiltered dream:\n\nIn my dream, I saw a corridor of books and shells stretching out before me, winding through a labyrinth of knowledge and secrets. The air was thick with whispers, as if the books themselves were speaking to each other in hushed tones. I walked along the corridor, running my fingers over the spines of the books, feeling the raised letters and embossed patterns on their covers.\n\nAs I turned a corner, I saw a great library stretching out before me, its shelves towering above like sentinels guarding ancient wisdom. The books seemed to be shifting and rearranging themselves, as if trying to convey some hidden message or code. I reached out to touch one of the volumes, and it felt warm to my fingertips, as if it had been freshly printed.\n\nBeyond the library, I saw a vast expanse of sea stretching out before me, with ships sailing across its surface like tiny dots on a map. The sky above was a deep shade of indigo, with stars twinkling like diamonds scattered across its surface. I felt a sense of longing and wonder as I gazed out at the endless waters.\n\nSuddenly, I heard the sound of shells clicking against each other, echoing through the corridor like a rhythmic heartbeat. I looked down to see that my hands were filled with shells of all shapes and sizes, their surfaces glinting in the dim light. I felt a sense of curiosity and wonder as I turned them over, trying to decipher their secrets.\n\nAs I walked further along the corridor, I began to notice that the books on the shelves were changing, shifting from leather-bound volumes to slim paperbacks with brightly colored covers. The shells in my hands were turning into tiny keys, unlocking hidden doors and revealing secret passages within the labyrinth.\n\nI felt a sense of disorientation as I turned a corner, finding myself back at the entrance to the corridor. But as I looked around, I saw that everything was shifting and flowing like a liquid, as if reality itself was fluid and malleable. The books and shells were merging together, becoming one with each other and with me.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I was awake.",
